# Codecademy Portfolio Project 
## Lunch Generator - Thomas Bell

### Purpose
This project was undertaken to demonstrate an understanding of Git, remote repositories, and basic Javascript syntax. 

The code makes use of *arrays* to store various food and drink items, and a random number function to select an item from these arrays. 
The selected food/drink item is then pushed into one of 2 randomly picked strings (which demonstrate understanding of if/else statements).
The string is then printed to the console with a console.log command. 

Throughout the project, Git was utilised to track changes, and upload to a remote repository on GitHub.

A README.md file was then created, demonstrating Markdown proficiency.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Git / GitHub
- Version Control
- Arrays
- If/else Statements
- Random number generators
- .length Property
